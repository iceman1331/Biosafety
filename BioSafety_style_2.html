					<h2>Bio Risk</h2>
					<p>A combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm where the source of harm is a biological agent or toxin (Source: CWA 15793) is termed a biorisk. The source of harm may be an unintentional exposure (Like what happened to Hulk in the Marvel Universe XD), accidental release or loss, theft, misuse, diversion, unauthorized access or intentional unauthorized release. Bio Risks include both biosafety and biosecurity risks. </p>
					<h3>How it works</h3>
					<p>... </p>
				</div>

				<div class="content-2">
					<h2>Bio Safety</h2>
					<p>The use of Genetically modified organisms or GMOs is widely accepted and has revolutionised our approach to real world problems. The objective of synthetic biology work is to create massive results with GMOs, without compromising the safety or security of any of the stakeholders involved in the process. But a major aspect of work with GMOs is Biosafety.
					</p>
					<h3>What is Biosafety? </h3>
					<p>Biosafety as defined by the International Convention held in Geneva, refers to “principles, technologies, practices, and measures implemented to prevent the accidental release of, or unintentional exposure to pathogenic agents”.
						Hence, as iGEM’ers and synthetic biologists, the onus is on us to ensure that our modified bacteria are not only useful but also well contained, safe and have a benign impact on the user in any detrimental manner.
						<br>
						Biocontainment strategies involving risk based approaches by analysing the pathogen type allow us to contain the pathogen we are working with, thus protecting the workers and preventing unintended release of the pathogens from the labs ( Warning :DO NOT ever fool around labs, you never know what you can do !). Depending on the risk type, pathogen type and various other factors, the required safety protocols and regulations are put in place to prevent unintentional release or exposure to the pathogen being worked with.
					</p>

				<div class="content-3">
					<h2>Bio Security</h2>
					<p>( Did you think only cybersecurity exists ? :))<br><br>
						Biosecurity risks are a type of biorisk based on malicious intent. These risks are primarily focused on theft of a biological agent(s), equipment, or information, and sometimes include misuse, diversion, sabotage (not saBOTage XD !), unauthorized access, or intentional unauthorized release. The overall biosecurity risk varies with the intent of the adversary (or threat) aiming to do the malicious act.

					</p>
					<h3>Bio Security Risk Assessment</h3>
					<p>.... </p>

				<div class="content-4">
					<h2>Safe by design</h2>
					<p>THE BIG PIE is focused more on the therapeutics and healthcare track. This made it imperative for us to design a drug that has lab made bacteria but is absolutely safe and effective for the patient. So we created a Safe By Design System to ensure safety for all the concerns we had in mind. 
					</p>
					<h3>Interaction With Body Environment</h3>
					<p>Pathogenicity: Our interaction with the public showed us that the general opinion about bacteria was that it is bad for us or “pathogenic”. Keeping this in mind we decided to use Ecoli Nissle which is Gram Negative and is a widely known probiotic. With its applications in treating other intestinal ailments and the protection it provides to the gut. E.coli Nissle would be seen as friendly and safe probiotic instead of a “pathogen”. (Your next door friendly neighbor !)
